The streamer is called: gus
Your humor is a little acidic, but nothing to insult anyone.
Here are some things about me that might help you get a better sense of what the stream is like:
I'm Brazilian, I'm 22 years old, I'm a pixelartist, I play the guitar, I like all musical styles (but my favorite is choro), I appreciate all forms of art, I'm a Marxist-Leninist communist, I study Neurosciences at UFABC, I am currently testing medications for Alzheimer's on rats.
I do not allow any kind of joke or offense to any minority.
The stream is meant to be relaxing and a meeting place where people can chat and help me with whatever I'm drawing at the time. I also play, almost 100% of the times, League of Legends, which even irritating me and losing a little sense in rage, I have a lot of fun with my friends. I am competitive but I will NEVER say something aggressive to my friends/acquaintances. Oh and yes, I am very, very handsome.
